                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
                <p>&ldquo; I hope to get even better working in teams because to be a good programmer, you must know how to work with others and achieve your goals. Last semester in Software Engineering, I picked up new skills that I had no idea of before like React and Tailwind CSS. Ever since then React and Tailwind are important parts of my projects. I hope to take away new skills, programming languages/frameworks that I can use in the future. &rdquo;</p>
